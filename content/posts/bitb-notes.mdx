I first read about BITB via community write-ups. A few useful links for context:

- Original write-up by mr.d0x (2022).
- Various roundups from detection vendors with mitigation notes.

### Defenders: Fast win ideas

1. Watch for iframe-heavy login screens with spoofed chrome graphics.
2. Educate users to drag auth pop-ups beyond the browser window bounds.
